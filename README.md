# Simon
A Simon game I used to learn JavaScript and jQuery.

This project is part of Angela Yu's course on Udemy to learn web development, based on the classic game Simon. I created the code, with guidance and sound files from the course. The original project called for each new level to only display the one additional step added for that level. I modified the code so that the entire sequence was replayed from start to the current level, making it closer to the original game.
